# Usage:
## Test
### Quick example
First you have to [download the example checkpoint file](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/ingan/resources/checkpoint_0075000.pth.tar), and put it in ``` InGAN/examples/fruit/ ```.
Will defaulty run on the fruits image, using an existing checkpoint.
```
python test.py
```

### General testing
By default, when testing you get a collage of various sizes and a smooth video of the transforms. You can also choose to test specific sizes, non-rectangular transforms and more.

See configs.py, for all the options. You can either edit this file or modify configuration from command-line.
Examples:
```
python test.py --input_image_path /path/to/some/image.png  # choose input image
python test.py --test_non_rect  # also output non rectangular transformation results
python test.py --test_vid_scale 2.0, 0.5, 2.5, 0.2  # boundary scales for output video: [max_v, min_v, max_h, min_h]
```
Please see configs.py for many more options


## Train
### Quick example
Will defaulty run on the fruits image.
```
python train.py
```
### General training
See configs.py for all the options. You can either edit this file or modify configuration from command-line.
Examples:
```
python train.py --input_image_path /path/to/some/image.png  # choose input image
python train.py --G_num_resblocks 3  # change number of residual block in the generator
```
Please see configs.py for many more options
### monitoring
In you results folder, monitor files will be periodically created, example:

## Produce complex animations by scripts:  
Please see the file supp_video.py

## Parallel training for many images
Please see the file train_supp_mat.py
